<p>I consider myself a generalist programmer, with a penchant for taking on challenging problems. Presently I am doing my Masters in Computer Science at Arizona State University. I have experience in building distributed scalable systems and leveraging data to solve problems. I was part of the pilot Data Engineering program at Insight Data Science where I built a robust data pipeline and got to learn from industry leaders on data science and engineering.</p>

<p>Prior to Masters, I worked as a software developer on a CRM application in the telecommunications space. When Iâ€™m not coding, I enjoy playing the guitar/bass (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNTWZHod_xQ&amp;list=UUyFOdJqkeHe8xhiSjTdmh3g">Some Randome Jams</a>)</p>
