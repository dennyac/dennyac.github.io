With my experience using Git so far, which is quite minimal, I have found the following commands to be extremely handy. Iâ€™ll keep updating this post from time to time, if I do come across other useful commands. Please note that some of these commands are not recommended as they might re-write history which may not be preferable. Also since I'm relatively new to git, some of these practices may not be advised. I would love to hear feedback regarding this post and about best practices to be followed.


In situations where your local repository is out of sync and you want to get it sync it with the central repository -
{% highlight bash %}
git reset --hard HEAD
git clean -f
git pull
{% endhighlight %}


To remove the most recent commit -
{% highlight bash %}
git reset --hard HEAD^
{% endhighlight %}


The "Branch-Edit-Commit-Merge" workflow -
{% highlight bash %}
git checkout -b branch-name
# Make changes
git commit -a -m "Change made"
git checkout master
git merge branch-name
{% endhighlight %}


To combine the last n commits into a single commit -
{% highlight bash %}
# Replace n with the number of commits to combine
git reset --soft HEAD~n &&
git commit
{% endhighlight %}


Forcefully push to a repository -
{% highlight bash %}
git push heroku master --force
{% endhighlight %}


Rebasing -
{% highlight bash %}
git checkout new-feature
git rebase master
git checkout master
git merge new-feature
{% endhighlight %}


To check out a remote git branch -
{% highlight bash %}
# Works with git versions >= 1.6.6
git fetch
git checkout <branch_name>
{% endhighlight %}


If you want to dicard or keep your uncommited changes to a branch aside, and continue to work on it later -
{% highlight bash %}
git checkout . # To discard changes
git stash      # To keep changes aside
git stash pop  # To bring them back
{% endhighlight %}


Syncing a repository with a fork -
{% highlight bash %}
git remote add upstream <repository_url> # To configure a remote to point to the upstream repository
git fetch upstream # Fetches from the upstream repository and stores it in upstream/master
git checkout master
git merge upstream/master
{% endhighlight %}
