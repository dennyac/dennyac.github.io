During my daily work, whenever I notice bugs, lack of documentation or features that could be useful in open source software I use, I make an attempt to contribute back during my free time. Maintainers generally welcome contributions, guide you and give good feedback during the process. I get pretty excited when an open source contribution gets accepted. Just compiling a list of contributions I've made so far.
